:iphone: The App
------------------
This app was made during GoStack Bootcamp! The idea was creating an app for buying sneakers using react-native and Redux!
I inpired this app in a fake Amazon Redesign, still using the products avaliable in the bootcamp api!
The GoStack Challenge original GitHub page can be seen [here](https://github.com/Rocketseat/bootcamp-gostack-desafio-07#desafio-07-redux)
(Brazilian Portuguese)

#### Changes and Implementations!
Compare my changes to the [*bootcamp correction*](https://github.com/Rocketseat/bootcamp-gostack-desafio-06/)

- Created an Amazon based app!
- Translated the products in the API!
- Used USD as currency!
- *Used a function/hooks format instead of a class/state* **(useState | useEffect | useMemo)**
- *Used Redux with React Hooks* **(useSelector | useDispatch)**
